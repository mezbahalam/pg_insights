PgInsights is a Rails engine that gives you a web dashboard for monitoring your PostgreSQL database performance. Think of it as a lightweight alternative to external monitoring tools that lives right inside your Rails app.

## ü§î Why I built this

I got tired of switching between different tools to check database performance. Sometimes you just want to quickly see which indexes aren't being used, or find slow queries without setting up a whole monitoring infrastructure. 

PgInsights gives you that - a simple dashboard you can access at `/pg_insights` in your Rails app.

## üéÅ What you get

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### üè• Health Dashboard
- Find unused indexes that are wasting space
- Spot tables that might need indexes (high sequential scans)
- Identify slow queries (if you have pg_stat_statements enabled)
- Check for table bloat that needs cleanup
- Review PostgreSQL configuration settings

</td>
<td width="50%">

### üîç Query Runner  
- Run your own SELECT queries safely
- Built-in queries for common performance checks
- Save queries you use frequently
- Results displayed as tables or charts

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2">

### üìà Timeline & Monitoring
- **Database snapshots**: Automatic collection of performance metrics and configuration parameters
- **Parameter change tracking**: Detect when PostgreSQL settings are modified over time
- **Performance trends**: Monitor cache hit rates, query times, and connection counts
- **Historical comparisons**: Compare database state between any two time periods
- **Export capabilities**: Download timeline data as CSV or JSON for further analysis
- **Configurable retention**: Automatic cleanup of old snapshots based on retention policy

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Smart execution
- Runs health checks in background jobs if you have them set up
- Falls back to running directly if you don't
- Caches results so repeated visits are fast
- Configurable timeouts to prevent slow queries from hanging

### Health Dashboard
Monitor your PostgreSQL database performance and identify potential issues at a glance.

### Query Runner
Run custom queries and visualize results with built-in charting capabilities.

## ‚è© Quick Start

Add to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pg_insights'
```

Run the installer:

```bash
bundle install
rails generate pg_insights:install
rails db:migrate
```

That's it. Visit `/pg_insights` in your browser.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The engine works out of the box, but you can customize it:

```ruby
# config/initializers/pg_insights.rb
PgInsights.configure do |config|
  # === Background Jobs ===
  config.enable_background_jobs = true
  config.background_job_queue = :pg_insights_health
  
  # === Health Check Settings ===
  config.health_cache_expiry = 5.minutes
  config.health_check_timeout = 10.seconds
  
  # === Timeline & Snapshot Settings ===
  config.enable_snapshots = true                    # Enable timeline feature
  config.snapshot_frequency = 1.day                 # How often to collect snapshots
  config.snapshot_retention_days = 90               # How long to keep snapshots
  config.snapshot_collection_enabled = true         # Master switch for snapshot collection
end
```

## üîÑ How Background Jobs Work

> **Note:** PgInsights uses on-demand background jobs, not automatic scheduling.

**When health checks run:**
- ‚úÖ When you visit the health dashboard `/pg_insights/health` and cached data is older than `health_cache_expiry` (default: 5 minutes)
- ‚úÖ When you click the "Refresh" button in the dashboard  
- ‚úÖ When you run `rails pg_insights:health_check` manually
- ‚ùå **NOT automatically** - PgInsights doesn't run background jobs on its own

**How caching works:**
```
Visit at 2:00 PM ‚Üí Runs health checks, caches results for 5 minutes
Visit at 2:03 PM ‚Üí Uses cached results (still fresh)  
Visit at 2:06 PM ‚Üí Data is stale, triggers new background jobs
```

**Background job setup (optional but recommended):**

If your app has background jobs (Sidekiq, Resque, etc.), PgInsights will use them for better performance:

```bash
# Check if background jobs are working
rails pg_insights:status
```

**Without background jobs**: Health checks run synchronously when you visit the page (slower but works)  
**With background jobs**: Health checks run asynchronously (faster, non-blocking)

**Optional: Automatic recurring checks**

If you want health checks to run automatically (not just on-demand), set up a scheduler:

```ruby
# Using whenever (runs every hour)
every 1.hour do
  runner "PgInsights::RecurringHealthChecksJob.perform_later"
end

# Using sidekiq-cron
Sidekiq::Cron::Job.create(
  name: 'PgInsights Health Checks',
  cron: '0 * * * *',
  class: 'PgInsights::RecurringHealthChecksJob'
)
```

**Note**: Even with automatic scheduling, the jobs are smart - they only run expensive queries if the cached data is actually stale.

## üíª Usage

Navigate to `/pg_insights` in your app. The interface is pretty straightforward:

| Page | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Query Runner** | Run custom queries and see results as tables or charts |
| **Health Dashboard** | Real-time database performance overview and issue detection |
| **Timeline** | Historical tracking of database performance metrics and configuration changes |

All queries are read-only (SELECT statements only) and have timeouts to prevent issues.

## üõ†Ô∏è Available rake tasks

```bash
# Configuration & Status
rails pg_insights:status              # Check configuration and background job status
rails pg_insights:test_jobs           # Test background job functionality

# Health Checks
rails pg_insights:health_check        # Run health checks manually (synchronous)
rails pg_insights:stats              # Show usage statistics

# Timeline & Snapshots
rails pg_insights:collect_snapshot    # Collect a database snapshot immediately
rails pg_insights:start_snapshots    # Start recurring snapshot collection
rails pg_insights:snapshot_status    # Check snapshot configuration and status
rails pg_insights:cleanup_snapshots  # Clean up old snapshots

# Data Management
rails pg_insights:reset              # Reset all PgInsights data (queries + health checks)
rails pg_insights:clear_data         # Alias for reset (backward compatibility)
rails pg_insights:cleanup            # Clean up old health check results (30+ days)

# Development & Testing
rails pg_insights:seed_timeline      # Generate fake timeline data for testing
rails pg_insights:sample_data        # Generate sample health check data
```

## üîí Safety

- Only SELECT queries allowed
- Query timeouts prevent long-running queries
- Focuses on public schema by default
- No modification of your data

## üóëÔ∏è Uninstalling

```bash
rails generate pg_insights:clean
# Remove gem from Gemfile
```

## üìã Requirements

- Rails 6.1+
- PostgreSQL
- For slow query detection: pg_stat_statements extension (optional)
